# Classic Margarita VS Tommy's Margarita

# For Tommy's Marg

The Tommy's Margarita is how a the Margarita should be served. Tequila is made from Agave and good Tequila is made from 100% Blue Weber Agave and what grows together goes together remains true by swapping the sweetner from simple syrup to an Agave syrup. Naturally a choice for people who are diabetic since Agave is lower on the Glycemic Index than traditional white sugar and because its viscosity and richness a little can go a long way. The removal of Triple Sec also takes away from the orange citrus flavour and allows for a slightly less drier version of the the Classic.

# For Classic Marg

The Classic Margarita is Superior to the Tommy's Margarita because it balances the flavours of acid, spirit, and sweetness with the Lime and Orange flavours mixing well and Tequila with Triple Sec raising the ABV and dryness of the cocktail allowing for slight increase in sweetner being used. When ordering out at bar or restaurant you will more than likely be served the version over the Tommy's since it norm.
