# Classic Margarita VS Tommy's Margarita

# For Tommy's Marg
The Tommy's Margarita is how a the Margarita should be served. Tequila is made from Agave and good Tequila is made from 100% Blue Weber Agave and what grows together goes together remains true by swapping the sweetner from simple syrup to an Agave syrup. Naturally a choice for people who are diabetic since Agave is lower on the Glycemic Index than traditional white sugar and because its viscosity and richness a little can go a long way. The removal of Triple Sec also takes away from the orange citrus flavour and allows for a slightly less drier version of the the Classic.
